    title: "Modular manual test for account management"
    description: "Objective: Verify the functionality of the account management module, ensuring users can perform essential actions related to their accounts.Test Steps:Data-driven manual test for account creation:Navigate to the store home page.Navigate to the account creation page.Input the test data based on the selected test scenario.Submit the account creation form.Verify the expected outcome:Successful account creation (for positive test cases).Edit Account Details:Navigate to the account details editing section.Modify one or more account details (e.g., change email address or update profile information).Save the changes.Verify that the changes are reflected in the account details.Expected Results:Successfully land on the store home page.Successful account creation for valid data.Successful editing of account details with proper reflection.Successful password change and subsequent login with the new password.Successful logout and redirection to the home page.Within this test we are using Test Case Versioning.Test cases evolve when requirements change, or improvements are made to the application under test. Although Xray logs test specification changes in the Jira history, it is not easy to revert to a specific test case version. With Test case versioning, you can now create multiple versions of the same Test allowing you to:Mark specific milestones of the Test with versionsView all previous Test versions and revert to a particular version if needed.Have multiple active versions simultaneously, even of different Test Types, as you can execute them all independently."
